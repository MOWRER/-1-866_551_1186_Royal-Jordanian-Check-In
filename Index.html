    <h1>Royal Jordanian Check In: Everything You Need to Know</h1>
    <p>Traveling with Royal Jordanian? The airline offers a smooth and flexible check-in experience designed for both leisure and business travelers. Whether you're flying domestically or internationally, Royal Jordanian provides multiple check-in options to save time and reduce airport stress. Here's a detailed breakdown of the Royal Jordanian check-in process, including online check-in, airport counters, mobile check-in, and self-service kiosks.</p>

    <h2>Online Check-In with Royal Jordanian</h2>
    <p>One of the easiest and most convenient ways to check in is via Royal Jordanian’s online check-in. Available through the official website or mobile app, online check-in opens 24 hours before departure and closes 4 hours before the flight for most international destinations. This option allows passengers to confirm their flight, select or change seats, and add extra baggage if needed. You can also download and print your boarding pass, or save it to your mobile device. This eliminates the need to wait in long lines at the airport, especially if you’re not checking in any luggage.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Check-In with the Royal Jordanian App</h2>
    <p>Travelers who prefer using smartphones can check in using the Royal Jordanian mobile app, available on both Android and iOS. The app offers similar features as the web-based online check-in, such as seat selection, baggage updates, and digital boarding pass generation. You can also receive notifications about flight changes, gate numbers, and baggage claim information directly on your phone. Mobile check-in is ideal for travelers on the go who want to minimize airport processing time.</p>

    <h2>Airport Counter Check-In</h2>
    <p>If you prefer to check in at the airport or need special assistance, Royal Jordanian airport check-in counters open approximately 3 hours before scheduled international flights and 2 hours before domestic flights. Check-in typically closes 45 to 60 minutes before departure, depending on the route and airport. Passengers are advised to arrive at the airport well in advance, especially during peak travel times, to complete check-in, security screening, and boarding without delays.</p>

    <h2>Self-Service Kiosks</h2>
    <p>At select airports, Royal Jordanian provides self-service kiosks that allow passengers to check in quickly without waiting in line at the counter. These kiosks are user-friendly and support functions such as seat selection, baggage check-in, and boarding pass printing. They are especially useful for travelers without checked luggage or those who want to speed up the process.</p>

    <h2>Baggage Check and Travel Tips</h2>
    <p>If you're traveling with checked baggage, ensure you arrive at the airport with sufficient time to complete both check-in and baggage drop procedures. For international flights, baggage drop usually closes 60 minutes before departure, and for domestic routes, at least 45 minutes prior. Always verify your baggage allowance based on your fare class and destination before heading to the airport.</p>

    <p>Travelers with oversized luggage, sports equipment, or pets should allow even more time to ensure smooth handling at check-in counters. Additionally, passengers requiring special assistance, such as wheelchair service or medical accommodations, should inform the airline at the time of booking and arrive early for dedicated support.</p>

    <h2>Contact and Customer Support</h2>
    <p>If you encounter any issues during the check-in process—whether online, via the app, or at the airport—you can reach Royal Jordanian’s customer service for prompt assistance. Their support team can help with boarding pass issues, booking changes, baggage concerns, and more. Dial the U.S. customer service number <strong>+1-866-551-1186</strong> for real-time help with your travel.</p>

    <h3>Final Tip</h3>
    <p>To enjoy a smooth experience with Royal Jordanian check-in, always double-check your flight details, arrive early, and make full use of the digital tools available. Whether online or at the airport, Royal Jordanian ensures a streamlined and professional check-in process for all its passengers.</p>
